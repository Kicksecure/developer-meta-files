KVM / Qemu:
===========

Entirely untested! This is only useful if you have a developers mindset!

This is the first time .qcow2 images are available:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonixdevelopermetafiles/files/whonix-7.7.6.4/

We have unfinished(!) instructions for KVM:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM

There are still a few blockers before using Whonix with KVM can be considered sane:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/KVM

Please help out solving them. Whonix also needs a maintainer to support using Whonix with KVM.

If you want to upgrade existing Whonix version:
###############################################

Sorry, upgrading from existing Whonix version (0.5.6, 7, etc.) to 7.7.6.4 (and 8 when it's released) will not be possible.

If you want to build images from source code:
#############################################

See https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/BuildDocumentation_8 and use git tag 7.7.6.4.

Physical Isolation users:
#########################

Use Debian stable instead of testing, use git tag 7.7.6.4 and see https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Physical_Isolation.

Changelog between Whonix 7 and Whonix 7.7.6.4 (testers-only version):
#####################################################################

* Whonix is now based on Debian stable instead of Debian testing.
* In new installations, automatic updates of Whonix's debian packages
are disabled by default. During first start, users can decide if they
want to enable Whonix's APT repository or want to leave it disabled.
* Fixed Whonix's Tor Browser download and start script for TBB 3.5.
* Fixed physical isolation build script.
* Verifiable Builds. Whonix now has a feature which allows the community
to check that Whonix .ova releases are verifiably created from project's
own source code. Also made ade Whonix's APT repository verifiable (even
deterministic!). Please see
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifiable_Builds for details.
* Made Whonix build script configurable (can now build terminal-only
Whonix-Gateway's and/or Whonix-Workstations; 64 bit builds and more)
* Improved Whonix News's security. All Whonix News Files are now inside
one tarball, which is signed. This stops leaking how many users are
using a particular version.
* whonixcheck's Whonix News download now checks if Whonix News are still
valid (currently up to 4 weeks) and therefore detects indefinite freeze
and replay attacks.
* whonix_repository tool now has a graphical user interface; added more
command line switches.
* Set default locale to en_US.UTF-8.
* Simplified custom user installation of TorChat, thanks to dummytor.
(Protecting from Tor over Tor.)
* Removed apper and synaptic from default installation, because they are
too confusing / have too many bugs, do not always work in all cases for
all users, #104, can still be manually installed if wanted, see also
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Automatic_Updates
* whonixcheck: more configuration options, any function can now be
disabled, this is useful for users who wish to disable control port
filter proxy, they can disable the check_tor_bootstrap function
* whonixcheck: added protection against possibly malicious strings from
check.torproject.org (in case of a bug, compromise of check.tpo server
or CA compromise), IP strings are now max 50 characters long. User will
be warned in case the limit is exceeded.
* Whonix-Workstation: no longer installing Tor Browser by default, this
simplified implementing verifiable builds (#113), installing iceweasel
by default, which can be used to download Tor Browser, added local
iceweasel browser homepage saying that iceweasel should not be used for
anything other than downloading Tor Browser, unless one knows what one
is doing.
* Removed galternatives from whonix-workstation-default-applications
because galternatives has been (temporarily) removed from Debian testing
* Building Whonix from frozen repository, from snapshot.debian.org to
make the build script more resistant from upstream changes and also to
make Whonix verifiable.
* The Whonix Team can now use separate keys for Whonix's APT Repository
and Whonix News.
* Added technical documentation about keys in Whonix
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/readme.
* new man page: man/whonix_shared/sdwdate.8.ronn
* Deactivated Maximizing Windows by dragging them to the top of the
screen to prevent users from accidentally maximizing their browser
window when they are using resolutions higher than 1024x768. See
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Higher_Screen_Resolution ;
https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/110 and
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7255 for more
information. #108
* added udisks to whonix-shared-packages-recommended for mounting
removable drives
* KDE settings changes, set to oxygen as suggested by scarp in
"[Whonix-devel] Plastique kwin style & Widget Style"
* whonixcheck: increased timeout for the tor bootstrap.py utility from 5
to 10 seconds to make it compatible with slow systems as per bug report
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:AWCforum/st/id248/whonixcheck%3A_tor_bootstrap_statu....html
* whonixcheck: Whonix News File is now deterministic
* whonixcheck: Whonix News added timeout for gpg and tar
* added secure-delete, because it contains sfill, which can be used to
zero out free space, which is required for disk shrinking
* Deactivated running update-command-not-found during build, since not
deterministic (verifiable). Manually running is of course still possible.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: removed the "deb
http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-0.2.4.x-jessie main"
repository, since that repository has been removed by The Tor Project
(Tor is now in their Debian testing repository, which is already added)
* fixed a bug reported by scarp,
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_disable_kdm_autostart: was
not disabling other display managers other than kdm. Now using the more
generic
/usr/lib/whonix/display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke.

* Whonix News Blog Download / Whonix News: Whonix News Blogs (Whonix
Feature Blog and Whonix Important Blog) are now deployed over the same
mechanism as Whonix News.
* Whonix-Workstation: better implementation of dummytor using config-package-dev (might break compatibility with Whonix 7)
* removed adrelanos' old key; removed whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_legacy (breaks compatiblity with Whonix 7)
* Re-implemented uwt and dummytor using config-package-dev instead of custom dpkg-diversions. Breaks compatibly with Whonix 7.
* Removed rawdog and pandoc since no longer required.
* moved misc scripts (Scripts for managing Whonix's offical repository and Whonix News; debug scripts; developer documentation and deprecated code) to https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files

giving up pseudonymity after collecting experiences with pseudonymous
project development
#####################################################################

You may have noticed that I, previously known only known under the
pseudonym adrelanos, decided to give up my pseudonymity. It was an
interesting experience to pseudonymously maintain a Linux distribution
(Whonix). I've learned a lot during these ~ 2 years.

I didn't have too bad luck in the lottery of life and are won a
citizenship, which is at low risk compared to less lucky ones. Living in
a country, where pseudonymity for this kind of activity isn't crucial.
Fortunately, according to latest press, neither the US nor Germany are
killing their own citizen for criticizing "the system". That is, the
mass surveillance police state, the military industrial complex, the
system of economy, that needs exponential growth to prevent imploding.
And so it doesn't become even worse, and better for the less lucky ones,
it is important to speak out in public and to take action.

Staying pseudonymous for such a long time became more and more a burden.
For me, it is not healthy for psychology. When pseudonymously working a a
project, you cannot tell anyone about it and they're wondering with what
you never tell much. You need to constantly second guess every tiny
action. Concentrate on not messing up. Also you'll never know if you
already messed up and if "they" already know who you are. You only need
to mess up once, and you're always linked to that project. Lucky me, I
wasn't forced to stay pseudonymous for ever.

I am looking forward to continue contributing to the awesome Free (as in
freedom) Software community. Being no longer pseudonymous allows me to
speak at conferences, to attend key singing parties, to meet up with
other developers, to voice chat with other developers, to chat on IRC
without fear of leaking too much information, to be less paranoid,
sometimes even running searches in clearnet if that is more convenient,
and so forth.

New Whonix Forum
################

We have a new forum. Can be reached under https://www.whonix.org/forum or
http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/forum.

The new link can also be found on the Support page:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support

This was necessary, because this forum has a bugs we're unable to fix in reasonable time:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:AWCforum/st/id35/New_forum,_new_bugs....html

Old topics may still be discussed in the old forum. Please do not create new
topics the old forum. Use the new forum for that.

Testers wanted! Testers-Only version Whonix 7.7.2 Debian Packages released!
###########################################################################

testers-only, which means apt-get could hang in half-broken state which
can likely be manually fixed. (Advanced Linux users, those comfortable
with Debian sid or so can even fix them themselves.) There is never 100%
security. Having snapshots/backups around is recommended. No
anonymity/privacy/security issues expected. By switching to the
testers-only repository you'll help a lot improving Whonix and speeding
up development (more eyeballs catching bugs). Stable releases will then
work better for everyone.

If you want to build images from source code:
=============================================

Currently not possible (or at least very difficult), due to two bugs
which have been recently introduced in Debian testing.

* http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734794
* http://ml.grml.org/pipermail/grml/2014-January/011547.html

It might take a while until these get fixed. I plan to base next
Whonix version on Debian stable instead of Debian testing to avoid
that kind of build bugs and to avoid

If you want to upgrade from Whonix's repository:
================================================

Switch to Whonix's '''testers-only''' apt repository.

First do these steps on Whonix-Gateway, then repeat on
Whonix-Workstation. There might be small bugs related to
whonixcheck/timesync, and you may need to reboot.

export WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRIBUTION_ENV=testers

Apply changes to which Whonix apt repository will be used.

sudo -E whonix_repository

The usage of the whonix_repository tool will be greatly simplified after
this upgrade, because a graphical user interface has been added so it
becomes easier to switch around.

Update and upgrade.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

If you want to upgrade from source code:
========================================

The tag for this '''testers-only''' version is '''7.7.2''' (don't use
7.3.7). Please refer to
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation and see "Build
Documentation for upgrading Whonix debian packages from source code".

Bonus: this is the first upload of Whonix's Debian Packages that is
verifiable [1]. If one would care to check if they can get the same
checksums as uploaded to Whonix's repository, that'll be awesome.
